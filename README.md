Demographix is a data visualization tool designed to showcase demographics of on-screen cast members in popular Hollywood movies. The project utilizes React on the frontend and a Flask server on the backend along with a PostgreSQL database modeled with SQLAlchemy. The app also utilizes machine learning APIs specifically OpenAI’s API as well as Google’s PaLM API to retrieve and display demographic data.
