She reprised the role of Laurie in the Halloween franchise, until 2022.\n\nCurtis's film work spans many genres outside of horror, including the comedies Trading Places (1983), for which she won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress, and A Fish Called Wanda (1988), for which she received a nomination for the BAFTA for Best Actress. Her role as a workout instructor in the film Perfect (1985) earned her a reputation as a sex symbol. She won a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Helen Tasker in James Cameron's True Lies (1994). Her other notable film credits include Freaky Friday (2003) and Knives Out (2019). Her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998.

After graduating with a BFA in Theater, he moved to New York City where he made a name for himself as a highly sought after fight choreographer for theater, opera and ballet companies all over the United States.

It was a natural progression for him and he particularly loved being part of the creative process.

2887	nm0001823	Tom Waits	2	1949-12-07 00:00:00	\N	Thomas Alan Waits (born December 7, 1949) is an American musician, composer, songwriter and actor. His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres.\n\nWaits was born and raised in a middle-class family in Whittier, California. Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk music circuit as a young boy. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazz-oriented Closing Time (1973) and The Heart of Saturday Night (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with Small Change (1976), Blue Valentine (1978), and Heartattack and Vine (1980). He produced the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's film One from the Heart (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.\n\nIn 1980, Waits married Kathleen Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart. This was reflected in a series of albums released by Island Records, including Swordfishtrombones (1983), Rain Dogs (1985), and Franks Wild Years (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director Robert Wilson, he produced the musicals The Black Rider (1990) and Alice (1992), first performed in Hamburg. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums Bone Machine (1992), The Black Rider (1993), and Mule Variations (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label ANTI-, which released Blood Money (2002), Alice (2002), Real Gone (2004), and Bad as Me (2011).\n\nDespite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international cult following, and several biographies have been written about him. In 2015, he was ranked at No. 55 on Rolling Stone's "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Tom Waits, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.

16483	nm0000230	Sylvester Stallone	2	1946-07-06 00:00:00	\N	Sylvester Stallone (born Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone, July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush.\n\nHe subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976–present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, he was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. His film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nUp until 1982, his films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Blood’s script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film’s production. He would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, he would go on to become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.\n\nHe declined in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, he launched The Expendables films series (2010–2014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis "Donnie" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought him praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.

21457	nm0000062	Elvis Presley	2	1935-01-08 00:00:00	1977-08-16 00:00:00	Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), or simply Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.\n\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll, though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African-Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of the White American youth.\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.

Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed "Lynchian", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they "disturb, offend or mystify" their audiences.\n\nMoving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.\n\nProceeding to create his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–1992), he also created a cinematic prequel, Fire Walk With Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his following films worked on "dream logic" non-linear narrative structures, Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001) and Inland Empire (2006).\n\nLynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, for his films The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, and also received a screenplay Academy Award nomination for The Elephant Man. Lynch has twice won France's César Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's top civilian honor, as a Chevalier in 2002 and then an Officier in 2007, while that same year, The Guardian described Lynch as "the most important director of this era". Allmovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking", whilst the success of his films have led to him being labelled "the first popular Surrealist".

10279	nm0386944	Adolf Hitler	2	1889-04-20 00:00:00	1945-04-30 00:00:00	Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, abbreviated NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. He was Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as head of state as Führer und Reichskanzler from 1934 to 1945. Hitler is most remembered for his central leadership role in the rise of fascism in Europe, World War II and the Holocaust. A decorated veteran of World War I, Hitler joined the precursor of the Nazi Party (DAP) in 1919, and became leader of NSDAP in 1921. He attempted a coup d'état known as the Beer Hall Putsch, which occurred at the Bürgerbräukeller beer hall in Munich on 8–9 November 1923. Hitler was imprisoned for one year due to the failed coup, and wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (in English "My Struggle"), while imprisoned. After his release on 20 December 1924, he gained support by promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and propaganda. He was appointed chancellor on 30 January 1933, and transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. Nazi forces engaged in numerous violent acts during the war, including the systematic murder of as many as 17 million civilians, including an estimated six million Jews targeted in the Holocaust and between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Roma, added to the Poles, Soviet civilians, Soviet prisoners of war, people with disabilities, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other political and religious opponents. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time mistress Eva Braun. To avoid capture by Soviet forces, the two committed suicide less than two days later on 30 April 1945 and their corpses were burned.	AUT	/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg

107509	nm2244474	Keith Buterbaugh	2	\N	\N	Born in Anchorage, Alaska, Keith grew up loving the outdoors, skiing, fishing, and camping until his parents returned to their roots in the Amish country of Western Pennsylvania. It was here, during his teenage years that he discovered music, acting and theatre. He received a bachelors degree in music education/trumpet from Clarion University and then spent the next three years as a high school band director in Northwestern Pa. From there, he moved to South Florida to work on a masters degree from the University of Miami in theatre/voice. After graduating, New York became his home as he pursued his love affair with story telling and performance.\n\nWithin three years, he was co-starring with Tammy Grimes, Off-Broadway in "Mademoiselle Colombe", when Harold Prince saw his work and invited him to join the Broadway company of "Phantom Of The Opera". Since then he has starred in Broadway productions working with Stephen Sondheim and John Doyle, regional theatre, opera, and an appearance at the White House for President George H. Bush. Symphonic concerts have taken him all over the world with Skitch Henderson and Peter Nero.\n\nEarly television appearances lead to more definitive work in film and episodic television, including "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel", "Royal Pains" and "Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll". Recent film work includes "Joker", "Red", "Diving Normal", and "Crime Partners".\n\nAs a writer, his screen play "Conduit" finds the most cynical woman on earth traveling through time to alter the events of 33 AD. Outrageous exploits and shocking discoveries force her to confront personal demons or risk a cataclysmic change of history.\n\nKeith continues to make the New York area a home for his family, and when he's not busy on set or in the theatre, he spends much of his time pursing his love for flying. As a single engine pilot, his perfect weekend is a flight to some location where he can return to the outdoors, golfing, scuba diving, skiing, camping or fishing.\n\n(Biography by SYI.)	\N	/7n0VSMTeyTuvLfgv7x2TLG0YD9G.jpg

She expressed this through school musicals and church plays from grade school through high school. In much of her free time, she was writing skits and performing them for her family. She attended many schools during her formative years, which instilled drive and independence in her. At eighteen, she went to Santa Monica College to pursue accounting and later landed a full time job as an accountant.\n\nHowever, she quickly realized her hunger was not being fulfilled. So she set sail and journeyed into the world of modeling. She quickly became the number one nude model in 1995 and was in over 150 magazines by '96. She completed more than 80 videos for Playboy, Penthouse and numerous independents.  After being in the industry for one year, Jacqueline's desire to grow as a person led her to acting classes.

Along with fellow Beatle Paul McCartney, he formed one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.\n\nBorn and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved as a teenager in the skiffle craze; his first band, The Quarrymen, evolved into The Beatles in 1960. As the group disintegrated towards the end of the decade, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and iconic songs such as "Give Peace a Chance" and "Imagine". Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to his family, but re-emerged in 1980 with a new album, Double Fantasy. He was murdered by Mark Chapman three weeks after its release.\n\nLennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, his writing, his drawings, on film, and in interviews, and he became controversial through his political and peace activism. He moved to New York City in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon's administration to deport him, while his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement.\n\nAs of 2010, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States exceed 14 million units, and as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 27 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth, and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all-time. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.	GBR	/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg

Soon after his birth, the family moved back to Israel where he grew up as an artistic kid, taking up painting, sculpting, photography and playing the guitar. But it wasn't until after his military service of 4.5 years that he decided to give art a serious try and enrolled in Tel Aviv University Film School. A short film he made there, A Nightmare on Bialik Street (1994) (a witty homage to the famous Russian film Battleship Potemkin (1925)), won several prizes and was later shown at the Cannes Film Festival. While acting in his own films, Aylam caught the 'acting bug' and so in early 2000 he returned to the US to study acting at The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, and later The Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York.\n\nWhile a student at the Strasberg Institute, he was hired to organize and preserve Strasberg's extensive collections of materials on acting - a position he held for the next 9 years, before starting to teach there. Upon graduating, he made his TV debut in the A&E mini-series Between the Lines (2004) hosted by Robert Downey Jr., where he joined the ranks of Hillary Clinton, John Goodman and Priscilla Presley in reading unknown letters written by famous people - his was no other than a love letter written by a young Adolf Hitler. Soon after, he played the leading role of a fugitive on the popular Fox show America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back (1988). He also wrote, produced and played the leading role in the movement-theatre show and film Beautiful World... (2006). Other film and TV roles followed, such as in the independent films Color of Truth (2009), Joy Incorporated (2012), Keep the Lights On (2012), and The Cold Winter (2016); the CBS film In God's Name (2007), and the hit NBC comedy show 30 Rock (2006), before Aylam made his way to Los Angeles.\n\nThere, he kicked things into high gear with multiple co-star and guest-star roles on such shows as Code Black (2015), NCIS: Los Angeles (2009), Shooter (2016), and The Guest Book (2017), while also lending his multilingual skills to ADR on numerous other TV shows and films. In 2017, Aylam filmed a supporting role opposite Rosamund Pike in the upcoming thriller The Informer (2019), and the series regular role of the villain in the new installment of the "Stargate" franchise: Stargate Origins (2018).

MTV banned him for life in 1989 for reciting what he called "adult nursery rhymes" during the annual Video Music Awards ceremony (September 6, 1989). The next year, when he was invited to guest host the weekly comedy TV show, Saturday Night Live, cast member Nora Dunn declared her refusal to ever appear on the same broadcast as Clay and did not participate in the episode of his guest appearance (May 12). Invited musical guest Sinéad O'Connor also boycotted Clay's appearance. Clay is known for playing the lead role in the film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane.

31512	nm0121559	Robert John Burke	2	1960-09-12 00:00:00	\N	A born-and-bred New Yorker, Robert John Burke made his film debut while in his early 20s with a small part in the drama "The Chosen" (1981), based on the Chaim Potok story. He went on to study acting at SUNY Purchase where he met aspiring filmmaker Hal Hartley, who cast him as one of the leads in his debut feature "The Unbelievable Truth," an offbeat indie tale where he played a man trying to escape his troubled past. Working with Hartley again on the charming brother-centric dark comedy "Simple Men," Burke caught a major break when Hollywood producers decided that his chiseled jawline was the right one to replace Peter Weller's in the sci-fi/action sequel "RoboCop 3." Despite Burke's efforts, the movie tanked, and he went on to smaller roles in major films, including the lauded Western "Tombstone" (1993) and the prison-break movie "Fled" (1996). Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation "Thinner" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke's leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley's "No Such Thing" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama "Oz" and the police procedural "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney's first two movies as director, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" (2002) and "Good Night, and Good Luck." (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary's lead character on the firefighter series "Rescue Me," a part that dovetailed with Burke's real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James "Chaos" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries "Generation Kill" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama "Gossip Girl." Before long, he was juggling his ongoing "Law & Order: SVU" part with regular spots on the military drama "Army Wives" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show "Person of Interest" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie "2 Guns" (2013).

2104810	\N	Victor Manuel Resendiz Ruiz	2	1967-10-25 00:00:00	\N	is a Mexican Luchador (professional wrestler) and actor. He is best known under his ring name Latin Lover, under which he is also credited in his acting career. Resendiz is best known for wrestling in the Mexican AAA promotion, but has also worked for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and currently works for the Perros del Mal and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotions under the ring name Latino. Resendiz and his partner Mariana Vallejo Isrrade won the very first Bailando por un Sueño dance competition in 2005. In late 2008 Latin Lover returned to wrestling, initially teasing that he would join the CMLL based group Los Perros del Mal, but in the end returned to AAA. At the Rey de Reyes (2009) tournament on March 15, 2009 he defeated Abismo Negro, Black Abyss and Dark Ozz to qualify for the final. In the final he was the last wrestler eliminated by the 2009 Rey de Reyes Electroshock.Following the Rey de Reyes tournament Latin Lover began teaming with Marco Corleone, a wrestler with a similar "Ladies man" character. The team challenged AAA World Tag Team Champions La Hermandad Extrema (Spanish for "The Extreme Brotherhood"; Nicho el Milinario and Joe Lider) in one of the featured events at Triplemania XVII, only to lose due to miscommunication between Latin Lover and Corleone.[12] On March 18, 2010, AAA announced in a press conference that they would no longer be booking Latin Lover, due to monetary issues and him no-showing the 2010 Rey de Reyes event where he was scheduled to be part of the main event. On April 11 Perros del Mal announced that Latin Lover would be joining the promotion and debuting the following month.[14] On June 4, 2010, Latin Lover returned to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, brawling with Héctor Garza.[15] After not appearing again for CMLL for months, Latin Lover returned to the promotion on November 26, 2010, confronting Los Invasores, a rudo group led by Garza. He was then attacked by the group, before being saved by Shocker.[16] Upon returning to the promotion, Resendiz adopted the new ring name of Latino.\n\nLegal actions against AAA\n\nIn early April, 2010 ex-AAA wrestlers Histeria and El Alebrije sought legal action against AAA over the issues of name and ring character ownership as well as unfair termination by AAA. The two claim that they have wrestled for 13 years to create the characters and thus own them. The parties met in Mexico City’s Board of Concilation and Arbitration to see if a settlement can be reached or if the matter will be taken to court.The parties met for a second arbitration meeting in late April, 2010. This time the plaintiff group was joined by Latin Lover who, like Alebrije, Histeria and the others, claimed that he should be allowed to use the ring name on the independent circuit since he's worked as Latin Lover for 18 years and thus should be allowed to continue using it. After the meeting it was stated that all parties involved were cooperating over the matter	MEX	/vFM7nzUcoofuyyC5rQosuLz4ztD.jpg

1701986	\N	Clementina Guadarrama	1	\N	\N	Hailing from Iguala, Guerrero, and being the eldest of five brothers and sisters, Clementina decided to defy her family and those around her, as she had fallen in love with theater. The culprit: the Mexican actor Esvón Gamaliel.\n\nDuring her adolescence she worked as a maid, just like her mother, and after seeing in Acapulco the play "Una tal Raymunda" by the Mexican master, Clementina decided that someday she would work with that man who stood on stage in a white suit.  At the age of 22, and with a child in her arms, she moved to the city of Toluca to study drama at the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México. Although this was the place that made her fall in love with theater and taught her to face her shyness, it was also the place where she experienced the first blows of the acting world. She was often discriminated against for being poor and having indigenous features.\n\nWith more maturity, Clementina began to write and direct her own plays. If society did not open doors for her, she would open them for herself. Which she continues to do to this day.  Clementina was part of several series on Channel 11, such as La Malinche, as well as popular characters such as Selena, Juan Gabriel and Julio Cesar Chavez.\n\nFilming the movie "Cría Puercos" allowed her to develop her first co-starring role. It was then that she received the call for a new project of which everything was kept secret. After three castings and many months later, he was confirmed: he would be part of "Roma", a film by Alfonso Cuarón.	MEX	/cT2pW7QEDpuvW75gOP0SD0EcpjF.jpg

Resilience, hard work, and sheer narcissism landed him roles on Canadian sitcoms Billable Hours, Little Mosque on the Prairie, and other shows that have gone on to relative obscurity and irrelevance. Upon moving from Toronto to Los Angeles, Brandon was cast as Jonathan Sidwell in Suits - which conveniently shot in Toronto. When not on set, Brandon spends his free time thinking about why he's not on set more, and contemplates what he can do to his physical appearance to get back on set. During these periods of intense self-loathing, he writes and performs comedy with his brother. Together, the brothers wrote and directed the award-winning satirical musicals SARSical and An Inconvenient Musical. Brandon is a graduate of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.

2037	nm0614165	Cillian Murphy	2	1976-05-25 00:00:00	\N	Cillian Murphy is an Irish film and theatre actor. He is often noted by critics for his chameleonic performances in diverse roles and distinctive blue eyes. A native of Cork, Murphy began his performing career as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play Disco Pigs in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and UK film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the post-apocalyptic film 28 Days Later.\n\nMurphy is best known for his work with director Christopher Nolan, where he appeared as the villain Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in all three films in the Dark Knight trilogy. Murphy has also worked with Nolan on Inception and Dunkirk. In 2013, Murphy started working on a TV show for BBC titled “Peaky Blinders” as the show’s lead role, Thomas Shelby. The show is still airing as of 2020 with five highly critically acclaimed seasons under its belt A resident of London since 2001, Murphy often works in or near the city and has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood. Uncomfortable on the celebrity circuit, he customarily gives interviews about his work, but does not appear on television talk shows or discuss details of his private life with the press.\n\nBorn in Douglas and raised in Ballintemple, two suburbs of Cork, Cillian Murphy is the eldest of four children. His father, Brendan, works for the Irish Department of Education and his mother is a French teacher. Not only are his parents educators, but his aunts and uncles are also teachers, as was his grandfather. Musicianship also runs in the family, and Murphy started playing music and writing songs at age ten. In mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time live-in girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, an artist whom he met in 1996 at one of his rock band's shows. The couple live in northwest London with their two sons Malachy (born in 2005) and Aaron (born in 2007).\n\nMurphy is known for being reluctant to speak about his personal life. He frequently gives interviews about his work but did not appear on a single live TV chat show, where actors customarily share information about their private lives, until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland's RTÉ to promote Perrier's Bounty. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Shy and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome." He intentionally practices a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk." Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a "surrogate movie dad". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.	IRL	/3DZAf9CwXmfV2HZOEdqeZAGTndV.jpg

Despite his parents' academic backgrounds, Billy has said that he was not interested in further education, and worked instead at the local Stephen Joseph theater, in community-based projects involving dance and acting. After a year at drama school, he enrolled at the prestigious Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, graduating in 2013. Having appeared at Bristol in 'The Little Mermaid,' his next stage appearance was in New York at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, opposite Lesley Manville in Richard Eyre's production of Henrik Ibsen's 'Ghosts' and a year later was reunited with Bristol Old Vic, the director, and Ms. Manville in a scorching production of 'Long Day's Journey Into Night' alongside Jeremy Irons - another Bristol Old Vic alumnus - Hadley Fraser, and Jessica Regan, more than holding his own with his older, more experienced co-stars. After a couple of small roles in television drama, Billy's first substantial lead came in the youth-oriented murder mystery Glue (2014) in 2014, opening the first scene in memorable style as he rolled nude down stacks of grain in a barn. In 2016, he was in another murder mystery, The Witness for the Prosecution (2016), as the defendant accused of killing his wealthy benefactress, by which time he had filmed his first forays into cinema: On Chesil Beach (2017) and Anton Chekhov's The Seagull (2018), both with Saoirse Ronan, and The Sense of an Ending (2017).

1095219	\N	Everything, Everywhere, All the Time	Everything, Everywhere, All the Time opens with the sound of musicians performing an old Icelandic folk song, Grýlukvæði. Only, a couple of years ago, they didn’t know each other - now they're touring Europe together.  In 2006, Icelandic producer Valgeir Sigurðsson founded the Bedroom Community record label with Nico Muhly and Ben Frost, soon adding Sam Amidon to the intimate roster. After three years of concerts, collaborations and acclaimed album releases, the then four artists of Bedroom Community headed out together for a trek across Europe: The Whale Watching Tour.  More than just a series of concerts, the tour was an extension of the ongoing musical exchange between these diverse artists, having them contributing to each other's music on stage. The film follows the four artists on tour, but also provides insight into the colorful characters and explores the vision behind Bedroom Community as well as introducing the home of the label, the Greenhouse studios.	\N	/yM7oszwq02LtJZVfP2yuAakMVaa.jpg	2011-09-29 00:00:00	\N	\N
537467	\N	Everything Everywhere Again Alive	In the early 1970s, Toronto filmmaker Keith Lock moved to Buck Lake, where members of the Toronto art scene were undertaking an experiment in communal living. Lock filmed the achievements and daily rituals of his fellow communards, his camera bearing witness as a community assembled and dispersed. The resulting film uses poetic strategies, including logograms and other graphic disruptions, to extend its themes of renewal and rebirth, and to mark the encounter between reason and imagination, the concrete and the abstract. A landmark work of Canadian underground cinema, a film diary with mystic and symbolic overtones.	\N	/ea1fsLuoxk15Dvxcb0EwmyA4Wee.jpg	1975-01-01 00:00:00	\N	\N
