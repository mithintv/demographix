Demographix is a data visualization tool designed to showcase demographics of on-screen cast members  in popular Hollywood movies. The project utilizes React on the frontend and a Flask server on the backend along with a PostgreSQL database modeled with SQLAlchemy. The app also utilizes machine learning APIs specifically OpenAI’s API as well as Google’s PaLM API to retrieve and display demographic data.

The data is broken down into four charts displaying gender, age, and race/ethnicity. The main page shows cumulative data of cast members of all the movies nominated for a specific award on a yearly basis. Additionally, you can filter by award, year, as well as a range of years which shows a summation of data from the last three, five, and ten years. All of the filters were created with a combination of React state management and AJAX requests made to a backend server. Additionally, I also implemented React Router into this project to ensure that each page has a specific url that can be easily shared while still maintaining the look and feel of a single page app.

To fetch and retrieve movie data on the backend, I used a Flask server hooked up to a PostgreSQL database modeled with SQLAlchemy. Most of the data was fetched from the The Movie Database (TMDB) API however, aside from gender and age, this API didn’t provide any information on race or ethnicity. Luckily, I was able to find several sites that stored ethnicity information about some cast members but because these sites did not provide an API, I am scraping these sites by using a library called Beautiful Soup, and then using regex, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (specifically a combination of OpenAI’s API and Google’s PaLM API  to parse through the sites and extract relevant ethnicity and race information and saving this to my database.
